## Description
Energy production prediction using Time series Models

** Project status: ** Completed

## Dataset
The data set contains 1006 entries for US monthly energy production from the years 1939-2022. These dataset has two columns, date(monthly) and energy production(quads).

## Data source: 
The data was sourced from the Federal Reserve Energy Data (FRED) [website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IPG2211A2N)

## Location
United States

## Description: 
Energy production is key in economic and social development.

Environmental factors lead to fluctuations in production.

These fluctuations lead to power outages resulting to business losses.

## Problem statement:
Energy production fluctuations do not only impact businesses but also homesteads. Therefore, there is a need to come up with a model that will help predict production to solve this problem.

## Technologies:
* python 
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* statsmodel
